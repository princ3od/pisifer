Some people think that children under 18 years old should receive full-time education.

Many feel that students should be required to attend full-time classes until the age of 18. In my opinion, when economically viable this mandate is advisable.

Those who oppose this policy argue it is impossible in more rural areas, particularly in developing nations. In such locations, children and teenagers often do not have convenient access to schools and assisting their parents with farm or other work is a greater priority. For example, in many rural villages in South Asia, even young children must lend a hand working to raise crops and livestock. The parents of these children can also make the legitimate argument that they are preserving a traditional and equally valuable way of life that does not involve modern schooling. However, these contexts are becoming rarer as individuals migrate to cities and the countryside receives improved infrastructure.

The main reason to support compulsory full-time education to the age of 18 is the opportunities it opens up in an evolving world. The lifestyle in rural areas that now seemingly justifies reduced schooling is disappearing due to more efficient farming equipment and the industrialization of production methods. Therefore, the most viable path for most individuals is to have an education through high school and ideally university that will endow them with employable skills. For instance, an individual who has learned a variety of subjects and graduated from formal schooling can then apply either for higher education or a job that requires a high school certificate. Both their worst and best case scenarios for the future improve considerably.

In conclusion, despite the valid reasons that exist in rural communities to de-emphasize education, it is worthwhile to enforce mandatory schooling for all minors. This is now more important than ever as job markets become more competitive.

Large companies use sports events to promote their products. Some people think this has a negative impact on sports.
It is common today for large corporations to promote products through various sporting events and teams. In my opinion, though this guarantees financial stability, it is a negative overall due to de-emphasis of the sport itself.

Those in favor of corporate sponsorship argue its financial flexibility. Most televised games, ranging from basketball and baseball in America to international sports such as football and rugby, are free of cost for viewers. This is only possible because of advertising during commercial breaks, billboards around the arenas, and product placement such as on player uniforms. Funds accumulated from such sponsorship not only allows the games to be broadcast free of charge but also enables team owners to maintain professional facilities and afford the salaries of the best players. If advertising were banned, owners would not be able to fund their team and players would eventually leave for wealthier leagues.

However, commodification also entails a reduction in focus on the actual sport. In the past, advertising was less obtrusive and might have consisted of a few commercials and signs in the background. Now, the announcers often work ads into their commentary and every highlight is accompanied by prominent logos on player jerseys. The effect aggregate is that audiences feel the games are only a means of advertising and they become indifferent the millionaire athletes and their multi-billionaire team owners. This has led many individuals, such as fans of English football, to sever connections to their childhood teams in order to support amateur community matches, which are not as commercialized.

In conclusion, despite the financial benefits of company sponsored sports events, the drawbacks related to the purity of the sport itself make this a negative trend. Owners and leagues must strike some balance but should prioritize a largely unadulterated product.
